        Title: “The Obsession” David, a lonely and introverted man in his early
        30s, works as a data analyst in a small office. He leads a monotonous,
        solitary life, spending his days buried in numbers and his nights
        staring at the profiles of women on social media. One day, he meets
        Anna, a charming and beautiful woman who works at a coffee shop next
        door. Over time, David visits the café daily, subtly building a
        connection with her, convinced she’s the one person who truly
        understands him.
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        As their interactions grow more frequent, David’s obsession with Anna
        deepens. He begins to follow her online, tracking her movements and
        obsessing over every detail of her life. But when David learns that Anna
        is engaged to another man, his world begins to unravel. The realization
        sends him into a spiral of jealousy and rage, leading him to confront
        Anna, hoping to convince her to leave her fiancé and be with him
        instead.
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        When she rejects him, David’s fixation turns dangerous. Desperate and
        unable to cope with the rejection, David retreats into a new obsession:
        creating a life-sized doll that he molds and dresses to resemble Anna.
        He pours all his energy into crafting the perfect replica—painting the
        doll’s face, styling its hair, and even dressing it in the same clothes
        Anna wears when she visits the café. Over time, he begins to treat the
        doll as if it were Anna, talking to it, confiding in it, and imagining
        that it responds to him.
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        The doll becomes his twisted surrogate for the real Anna, a way to feel
        as though he has control over her and their relationship. He speaks to
        it as though it were alive, sharing his every thought, and even attempts
        to mimic Anna’s voice and actions when alone with the doll. But his
        obsession grows darker as he begins to believe the doll is more than
        just a lifeless object—it is his only connection to Anna, and through
        it, he feels empowered.
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        David’s growing obsession with the doll takes a violent turn when he
        realizes he must eliminate the man standing in his way. He stalks Anna’s
        fiancé, and after a brutal confrontation, he decides that Anna, too,
        must be brought under his control. As his sanity deteriorates, David’s
        fantasy world becomes more chaotic and his grip on reality more tenuous.
        His obsession with Anna and the doll consumes him entirely, leading him
        down a path of irreversible destruction.

        Themes: Obsession, loneliness, rejection, control, delusion,
        psychological decline, and the blurred line between reality and fantasy.
      </p>

      <p class="p1">
        The doll serves as both a symbol of David’s desperate need for control
        and a manifestation of his unhealthy fixation on Anna, illustrating how
        far he’s willing to go to construct a reality where he holds power over
        her.
